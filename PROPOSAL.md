# Just Cook Bro - Project Proposal

## 1. The Problem
**People are not excited to be in the kitchen.**

For many, the simple act of finding a recipe is stressful and overwhelming. The modern cooking experience is fragmented: users jump between physical cookbooks, ad-heavy blogs, YouTube videos, and social media shorts. This context switching creates friction, and friction kills motivation.

We identified a simple truth:
**Action = Hunger - Excuses**

When the excuses (complexity, time, decision paralysis) outweigh the hunger, people order delivery instead of cooking.

## 2. The Solution
**Just Cook Bro** is an AI-powered cooking assistant designed to eliminate excuses. It centralizes the entire cooking workflow into one cohesive experience, acting as an activation engine for home cooks.

### Key Features:
*   **Instant Recipe Generation:** Users can type a craving ("Spicy Pasta") or snap a photo of ingredients to get a structured recipe instantly.
*   **Unified Cooking Mode:** No more scrolling past life stories on blogs. The app provides a focused, step-by-step interface with built-in timers and AI guidance.
*   **Dietary Enforcement:** The AI strictly enforces user profile constraints (Allergies, Vegan, Keto), making it safer than standard search engines.

## 3. Target Audience
*   **The "Passive Consumer":** People who watch hours of cooking content (TikTok, YouTube Shorts) but feel too overwhelmed to cook themselves.
*   **Gen Z / Young Professionals:** Digital-natives who demand speed, visual validation, and mobile-first experiences.
*   **Diet-Conscious Cooks:** Individuals with specific needs (Keto, Gluten-Free, Allergies) who find filtering standard recipe sites difficult and risky.

## 4. Monetization Strategy
We utilize a **Freemium Subscription Model** managed via RevenueCat. This ensures low friction for new users while capturing value from power users.

## 5. Narrative & Inspiration
The inspiration behind **Just Cook Bro** was personal. I realized I often delayed cooking simply because I didn't want to make decisions. One day, hungry and out of options, the phrase *"Just cook, bro"* clicked. It was a call to action—direct and honest.

We built this app to embody that philosophy:
$$ \text{Motivation} \approx \text{Simplicity} + \text{Accountability} $$

**Just Cook Bro** turns hunger into action.
